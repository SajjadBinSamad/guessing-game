The chain rule is used to find the derivatives of composite functions like (x2 + 1)3, (sin 2x), (ln 5x), e2x, and so on. If y = f(g(x)), then y' = f'(g(x)). g'(x). The chain rule states that the instantaneous rate of change of f relative to g relative to x helps us calculate the instantaneous rate of change of f relative to x. Let us learn more about the chain rule formula and the steps followed in finding the derivatives using the chain rule.
